# Blueprint Microservices Compiler

Blueprint is a microservice development toolchain designed to make it easier for researchers to easily prototype infrastructure for microservice applications and compile those prototypes into a variety of benchmark applications.

Blueprint is currently pre-release with most features implemented; the full v1.0 release is coming soon.
