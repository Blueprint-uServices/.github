### Blueprint Microservices Compiler

Blueprint is an extensible compiler for microservice applications, along with a collection of off-the-shelf microservice benchmark applications.  Blueprint is particularly aimed at prototyping and experimentation use cases.  It is intended for use by anybody, but particularly researchers and practitioners wanting to experiment with microservice applications.

Blueprint is currently pre-release with most features implemented; the full v1.0 release is coming soon.  Visit the [blueprint](https://github.com/Blueprint-uServices/blueprint) repository to get started.
